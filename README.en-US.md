### 🚀 Background Introduction

In a complex development environment, we often need to handle multiple projects and their dependencies simultaneously. Frequent branch switching and dependency installation can be cumbersome and prone to errors. Previously, I had to manually copy projects from different branches and name them after their branches, which was not only inefficient but often resulted in opening the wrong branch. To simplify this process, I decided to develop the **Project Manager Next** extension to help developers efficiently manage their projects and branches.

### ✨ Features

- **Project Management**: Easily showcase projects from "Recently Used" and "Favorites" for quick access.
- **One-Click Favorites**: Quickly add projects from "Recently Used" to Favorites for easy retrieval.
- **Flexible Project Opening**: Supports opening projects in the current window or a new window, enabling seamless environment switching.
- **Branch Display**: The sidebar displays a list of projects and shows branch names in real-time, clarifying the current context.
- **Project Copying**: Supports project copying with auto-incremented naming to avoid naming conflicts and save time.
- **Project Renaming**: Easily rename projects to keep the file structure tidy and facilitate management.

### 📦 Installation Guide

1. Open VSCode and go to the extensions marketplace.
2. Search for **Project Manager Next** and click install.
3. Launch the extension and enjoy an efficient development journey!
