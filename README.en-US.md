### 🚀 Background Introduction

In a complex development environment, we often need to handle multiple projects and their dependencies simultaneously. Frequent branch switching and dependency installation can be cumbersome and prone to errors. Previously, I had to manually copy projects from different branches and name them after their branches, which was not only inefficient but often resulted in opening the wrong branch. To simplify this process, I decided to develop the **Project Manager Next** extension to help developers efficiently manage their projects and branches.

### ✨ Features

- **📂 Project Management**: Easily display projects in "Recently Used" and "Favorites" for quick access.
- **⭐ One-click Favorites**: Quickly add projects from "Recently Used" to your favorites for fast retrieval.
- **🔄 Flexible Project Opening**: Support opening projects in the current window or a new window, seamlessly switching work environments.
- **🌿 Branch Display**: Sidebar displays a list of projects with real-time branch names, clarifying the current context.
- **📋 Project Duplication**: Support for project duplication with auto-incrementing names to avoid naming conflicts and save time.
- **✏️ Project Renaming**: Easily rename projects to keep your file structure tidy and manageable.

### 📦 Installation Guide

1. Open VSCode and go to the extensions marketplace.
2. Search for **Project Manager Next** and click install.
3. Launch the extension and enjoy an efficient development journey!
